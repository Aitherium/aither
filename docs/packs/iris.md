Installs to `~/.aither/packs/iris/`, which adk discovers with no
configuration. The installer verifies the pack is discoverable rather than
assuming it. adk itself:

```bash
pip install aither-adk
```

## About

The image-generation counterpart to the aither orchestrator pack. Iris stands
up her OWN image-gen backend (via the imagegen_* bootstrap toolpack), then
generates through it — ComfyUI for control, SANA for speed. She knows the one
law that governs character work: txt2img + IPAdapter CANNOT pin a character.
